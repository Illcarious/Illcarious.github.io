<p>Hi time traveller, please check out my updated <a href="/">website</a></p>
<p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Bruce Lee once said, "I don't fear the man who practices 1000 kicks in one day. I fear the man who practices one kick a day for 1000 days". And since I am relatively new to this whole coding industry, 
I will do my best to practice one kick a day for the next, I guess, thousand days. So here I will post one <em>new</em> "skill" a day. Be that uploading a photo and then a video, or testing out
a different framework? Let's see what happens. Also, I'll change the layout of this page, make use of better colors, fonts, etc. later on.</p>

	<ul class="posts">

	  {% for post in site.posts %}
	    <li class="norm"><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a class="norm" href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
