<h2>I'm sure you've heard</h2>
<p>the saying "cross the bridge when you get there". I'm not going to cite this quote because I have no idea who said, I don't want to search it up, and quite frankly, I'm a little annoyed by it. Not by the use of the saying itself but by the different contexts that I've heard it being used--when talking with me!--and it's just such a cop-out attitude (when they use it when talking with me). Now I've used it too myself, during the right circumstances a.k.a. when you need to make an immediate decision when there are multiple future scenarios that can play out. You can then "cross that particular bridge when you get there", but first make your decision, "plug that hole in the sinking ship" (I admit I paraphrased that quote from Steve Jobs who paraphrased it from someone else - you can read about it in Walter Isaacson's biography of <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>). But when it's used as the answer to a very consequential decision like: "do you want to have kids if we marry? Because I want to have kids" and the answer is "we'll cross that bridge when we get there", like NO! You can't/shouldn't/shan't do that! That's not fair to either of you. Just know in which context to use it and if need be, use it accordingly.</p>

<p>I find rebeccapurple to be the most interesting name for a color. Though it reminds me of Rebecca Black and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0" target="_blank">Friday</a>. Aww yeah such lucid memories. Anyway, today was the first day back in school. I've got a pretty packed semester in my opinion since I just finished my data structures and algorithms course from the summer time (A+ least I did well. See what I did there? Heh heh? &#128522 &#9996;&#127995 <-hopefully that worked.
But yeah first day back, I'm in all 3rd year courses, because well, I'm in a hurry. Most excited and scared about AI (haha... like everyone in the world) and most interested about Human-Comp Interactions. A little nervous about Computer Graphics because of the math involved but unless I'm going through hell, I'll grind it out. Databases is tomorrow; from first read of the textbook, it seems really interesting and [insert text here] I don't wanna jinx it. But AI, jeez, 3 assignments and a freaking research paper. I mean it's not like I've never written (16+ -- biosci is a b*) research papers before but AI research paper seems a little-it's a challenge for sure, to see where my own <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-Innovation/dp/1594485380" target="_blank">adjacent possible</a></em> is.
