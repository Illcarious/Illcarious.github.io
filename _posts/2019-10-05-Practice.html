      <h2>Brush up</h2>
      <p style="margin: 20px 50px;">I'm playing around with the CSS right now because I'm trying to brush up my coding for the CSS quiz that's coming up. It's honestly a very short quiz with the goal of making sure you are adequate with your CSS knowledge to design dynamic sites. Not too much stress for that. But I still have to brush up and practice.</p>
      <p style="margin: 20px 20px;">I have this AI assignment due on Friday, which is a decent amount of time, but it's getting at me because even though I know that I have to implement a stack to do DFS it still requires the case-dependent code to find its way through the maze. I think I'll read through the textbook and notes again before tackling the problem because I'm pretty sure I know I can do it, it's just a little abstract right now how to code it.</p>
      <p style="margin: 20px 50px;">Haha, I'm taking this database course right now and legit as soon as we go over the assignment (as in already handed it in), everything clicks for me and I figure out how to do it the right way. Haha ahh that's just how I operate I guess. The first draft is for the trash. It feels that way with so many things I do. First degree; first (pseudo)relationship; first lease on life... I know there are some things that I can't leave for the second time around to get right (*<strong>cough</strong>*midterms/finals*<strong>cough</strong>*) but lots of the things that I do sure take 2 tries to get right (though perfectly &#x1F601)</p>

      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <p>This isn't a game, this is practice. This is practice man. I mean if it were some suuuuper important thing, then yeah it'd be important but this is practice man. We're talking about practice man. <em>Practice</em>. This isn't a gentrified project, it's practice. We're talking about practice man. I know it's important, but we're talking about practice.</p>
      <p>Allen Iverson said the word <em>practice</em> 22 times. <strong><em>22</em></strong> times!!! Most university students aren't even 22 years old!! I know this has nothing to do with anything, it's just a fun-ny fact.</p>
      <p>And I'm done.</p>
      <p>But seriously, I have a quiz on CSS in the next couple of weeks, so I'm just trying to shake the rust off. And yeah, it's been a while since I've posted anything so just trying to remember my html layout style was an interesting experience.</p>

      <h2>As much fun as it is to rib Allen Iverson</h2>
      <p>He is trying to make his point. We get what he's trying to say, it's just funny how it turns into one of those arguments that only make sense/take on the right meaning/context (wow) when you repeat it a couple times with emphasis on that perspective, which by the way is only attainable through repeating it several times. Hahaha</p>
