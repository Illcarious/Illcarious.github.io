      <p>how much of a post I can crank out before I leave for a dinner.</p>
      <p>Seek first to understand, then to be understood. That's the premise of all arguments. One side is trying to make a point. The other doesn't understand, or doesn't even allow one side to finish. Then the other side tries to make their point. And thus the first person hasn't even had the chance to finish their point and already they have to defend against this other person's point. It's a scary and unproductive cycle that can be avoided if you are to jseek first ot understand then to be understood.</p>
