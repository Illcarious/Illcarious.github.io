    <p>But seriously, what's with all the websites and apps using 'dark mode'? I mean I know that's how 'desktop' was originally going to be rolled out (Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs worth a read) but right now it's like all over the place. I have my YT app on my phone giving me a dark mode; FB messenger's got dark mode; <a href="https://www.capfriendly.com/" target="_blank">NHL salary caps</a> are in dark mode... I'm not complaining, just wondering why there's now an explosion of dark mode (I mean I know Apple's a trailblazer but like meh). I don't want to bring too much of my personal life into these posts but today I saw her in the gym again, and she is very pretty. I'm not sure if she's a freshman though, looks/seems more mature but can't be certain. I don't really care about the woman's age, I care mostly about their personality and sense of humor. I value laughter and an optimistic/joyful attitude in a relationship and I won't be with someone just because they are pretty. Life's too precious to brush it all off.</p>
