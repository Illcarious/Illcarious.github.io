      <p>But seriously, what's with all the websites and apps using 'dark mode'? I mean I know that's how 'desktop' was originally going to be rolled out (Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs worth a read) but right now it's like all over the place. I have my YT app on my phone giving me a dark mode; FB messenger's got dark mode; <a href="https://www.capfriendly.com/" target="_blank">NHL salary caps</a> are in dark mode... I'm not complaining, just wondering why there's now an explosion of dark mode (I mean I know Apple's a trailblazer but like meh).</p>

      <h2>That idea about making these posts scalable?</h2>
      <p>It feels like the things I'm learning in JS through <strong><a class="norm" href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></strong> is all Java-like (not that I'm a master at either Java or JS) and so these new things that I'm trying to put out there don't feel novel.</p>
      <p>Time is the one thing we can't buy more of. It's the one thing that allows the most happiness; the most sadness; the most joy; and the most regret to occur. It's the one thing we should really optimize for everyday. <em>What</em> you want to do with you time is totally up to you. <em>I</em> hope to spend most of my time with my family (the maturer stages/phases of family) as well as my work to get something done on this planet. I do not take love for granted. After being in a pseudo-relationship (long-distance one at that), I do not take the simplest things for granted. Just being in the same city as her. Being able to see her in person, hug her, hold her in my arms... I don't take these things for granted. And I hope that I will have the opportunity (soon) to love someone with every fibre of my being.</p>
      <p>This is the time I started writing this part of the post:</p>
      <p id="one"></p>
      <p>This is the time right now</p>
      <p id="now"></p>
      <script>
        var d = new Date(2019, 08, 25, 07, 33, 35, 0);
        var dn = new Date();
        document.getElementById("one").innerHTML = d;
        document.getElementById("now").innerHTML = dn;
      </script>
      <p>Cherish the moments. Cherish what you have. Don't take even the smallest things for granted. <strong>I know I won't</strong>
