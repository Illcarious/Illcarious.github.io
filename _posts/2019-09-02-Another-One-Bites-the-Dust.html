<h2>The thing about trying new things...</h2>
<p>... is that sometimes we fail. I spent 2 hours this morning before writing this post trying to figure out how to import a game I made in my second CS course (<cite><a href="https://www.freeinvaders.org/" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a></cite>) into a post I make on here as the "new thing" I try. I was trying to watch a tutorial online and read some walkthroughs but the furthest I got was importing my github repo url into my eclipse environment and then I tried to share my project with the github repo but it said that there was a clash with the '.project' that was already in the folder I was trying to share my 'test' project into? Anyway, I tried a couple of things, I feel like it would have worked if I went down my thought path, but then I would've had to figure out how to actually 'call' my project from my new repo into this post. I'll try taking a smaller step today and maybe trying to take that bigger step some other day.</p>
<br>---</br>
<p>On another note, I was looking at the course registration website that my uni implemented and taking a peek at the source code (like right click then inspect/source code) and man compared to another uni's website design, it feels like I can fiddle around with the html and css/js and make our uni's website a little more attractive. It feels so cool being able to look at a website's source code and (sort of) understand what went in to make it look the way it does.</p>
<p>But I also have another project/goal in mind, if I get to tinker with the uni's course reg. UI, then I want to also implement an algorithm to help students pick the best schedule for their semester (a schedule planner). I want it to be able to look at the up to 6 courses (crazy engineering students) that a student would take, and present a schedule optimized for:
<ol>
<li>Early start/early end</li>
<li>Late start/late end</li>
<li>Shortest time at school</li>
<li>Most time-effective for students with jobs during the school week (plus best transit times as well if possible)</li>
</ol>
<br></br>
<p>I feel like this would be such a cool thing to contribute to the school and give some practice to students without too much practical experience (besides school projects) with coding.</p>

<div id="new thing">
<p>welp, this would've been the place to embed my game, but since it's for another time...</p>
	<p>so this effect only works in chrome desktop browser? unless I'm forgetting to do something?...</p>

<p>Hello.
Guffaw. In <a href="https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Everything_Store.html?id=t95iRvivDHIC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank"><em>The Everything Store</em></a> Brad Stone describes Jeff Bezos's laugh as a guffaw.
Goodbye.</p>
</div>
<p>anyway hopefully that worked. *updated the parallax effect 8 months later. Hopefully it actually works on desktop and mobile now.</p>
