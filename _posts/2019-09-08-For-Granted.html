      <h2>After reading through some of these tutorials, I find that we take our brains and natural processes for granted</h2>
      <p class="example">When we want to draw a picture or write some words or make a decision or reach for a cup or identify a dog, we do it so effortlessly. Of course it takes a bit of training to start it off but afterwards, we are just such automatic creatures. Just reading through some of this CSS tutorial stuff, it makes me really take the time to admire the human brain. Just wanting to format this paragraph, with the proper spacing and margins and border placement requires explicit instruction from the programmer. Now it makes sense that these things need to be finely controlled to achieve the look you want, but it's just amazing to me how we do these things without really thinking about the numbers behind it. Of course, the computer can't actually "see" the screen so it needs to use numbers as reference points to be able to know where to put different things; but you never really realize how much processing needs to go into these activities for you to get the outcome you were looking for. The dots are already connected for you.</p>

      <h2>For this new thing, I will be adding new effects to existing HTML infrastructure</h2>
      <p>I feel like the human mind is both under-utilized and under-appreciated. So much of what we do, we don't need to think about. Of course that can't be said about your Nephrology exam, but the majority of survival instincts and everyday functioning is done for you automatically. You don't think about every time you breath; activating your aortic pumps to allow bloodflow throughout your body's circulation; DNA replication to heal that open wound you got from your ex (a broken heart needs healing too); riding a bike (once you've learned how to)... these things are all/become automatic. This allows us to free up brain power to use for solving the theory of relativity; understanding the concentration gradient in a nephron; deciding whether to vote Democrat or Republican; and learning C programming in the basement of your uni's engineering building because there were no other rooms available during the summer months. And quite frankly, two of these are harder than the others - and then there's the theory of relativity and nephron physiology.</p>
      <p>I've found that these books paint a solid picture of the brain and what it can do:</p>
