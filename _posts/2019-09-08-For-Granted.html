      <h2>After reading through some of these tutorials, I find that we take our brains and natural processes for granted</h2>
      <p class="example">When we want to draw a picture or write some words or make a decision or reach for a cup or identify a dog, we do it so effortlessly. Of course it takes a bit of training to start it off but afterwards, we are just such automatic creatures. Just reading through some of this CSS tutorial stuff, it makes me really take the time to admire the human brain. Just wanting to format this paragraph, with the proper spacing and margins and border placement requires explicit instruction from the programmer. Now it makes sense that these things need to be finely controlled to achieve the look you want, but it's just amazing to me how we do these things without really thinking about the numbers behind it. Of course, the computer can't actually "see" the screen so it needs to use numbers as reference points to be able to know where to put different things; but you never really realize how much processing needs to go into these activities for you to get the outcome you were looking for.</p>
