      <h2>Just spent the past week straight</h2>
      <p>Coding the sh!t out of my artificial intelligence assignment. AI, from what I've seen, is algorithms. Algorithms that inform the decision-making process (or lack thereof). In my first-year computer science course my prof. said something that will stick with me for the rest of my coding career: The problem is always you. You might <em><strong>think</strong></em> that your code is f*cking magnificent, but if it doesn't run the way you want it to, the problem is not the computer's, it's yours.</p>
      <p>I feel like that is applicable to life in general. Not it's not the computer's problem; the it's <em>your</em> problem. Everything the works or doesn't work in your life is because of you. And the only way to make it work, from what I've seen, is to just attack it. Grind that sh!t out. People don't remember how many times you failed (unless you're in sports). They only remember that you succeeded. <strong>That</strong> you succeeded. Everybody on Earth is too selfish to care about you in general. They definitely don't have enough time to care about how many times you've failed.</p>
      <p>So honestly just try this: fail your way to success. Fail and fail and fail until you <em>can't</em> fail anymore. Was it Edison who said he found 13000 ways to <em>not</em> make a lightbulb? You can fact-check me on that one.</p>

      <p id="size">Okay, so I got a HCI midterm coming up which is testing us on design philosophy and how to achieve ideal user interaction. Suffice it to say, I need to study up. There's also some assigned readings (!oh!, yeah I'm going to go read that right after I make this post) and a video that I need to watch that is testable material. And there's the JS and jQuery quizzes that are coming up one right after the other so I'm trying to learn JS as much as possible right now. Haha desperation brings out the urgency in people.</p>
      <p>So far, for some reason, I'm enjoying databases. I think it's because the concepts are so logical (at least right now). It just seems so intuitive and right and it feels good to implement, though we haven't actually begun to use SQL or any query language yet. HCI is maintainable. Interesting stuff, but very design-focused versus computer science-focused. AI seems to be the harder one out of the three. Mainly, I think, because it's about algorithms and training your brain to think as a computer. You can't program intuitive decisions into the code. Since we take for granted our decision making process so much, we forget that there was a process in making it to the final solution in the first place. It's a really interesting process. You have to take a step <strong>forward</strong> in this case and actually think through each decision you make in order to program the 'intelligence'. It really makes you appreciate what your brain does for you.</p>
