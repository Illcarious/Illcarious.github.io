      <h2>Innovation</h2>
      <p>At times it feels like the world is stagnant. You don't hear about revolutionary innovations that often, or as often as it felt like things were happening just a couple decades ago. Sometimes I wonder, would the present generation have been able to figure out some of the stuff our ancestors/predecessors figured out? Would we be able to figure out the structure of DNA? Figure out the microprocessor and the computer? If the world had a reset button, how long would it take this generation of people to bring the world from our caveman days to the way we are now? It's amazing to hear how many of the great thinkers of our history came to be by doing just that for the majority of their days. Just thinking. I've read that Bill Gates takes a couple weeks off in a year just to go and think/read new knowledge. Then I see how many kids/teens/young adults spend the so much time just on Instagram. If we all were to just give ourselves some time a day, maybe even 30 mins, just to think-whether it's about quantum physics or about that guy/girl you have the biggest crush on... I wonder what we'd be able to achieve as a species. Maybe we would somehow figure out teleportation? <em>Basically</em> just the transportation of physical molecules from one location to another. I mean it seemed impossible only <a href="https://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1870.xhtml" target="_blank">2 centuries ago</a> to talk to someone in Jerusalem when you were in Los Angeles. That became possible since it was just the delivery of sound waves to the other person. So why not transporting physical molecules from one place to another? That's something we can think about. Here's proof we aren't thinking anymore: the new <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-11-leaks-release-date-rumours-3688678" target="_blank">iPhone</a> camera, what they were thinking (hint: they weren't)</p>
      <p>Don't be rash with your decisions... think them through. It is <b>your</b> life, you may as well give it some good thought. <em>Think</em> about who you want to be. <em>Think</em> about what you want to be. <em>Think</em> about who you want to marry; where you want to travel; what you want to be remembered as. Nothing can be achieved without thought, first. Nothing has even a chance of being recognized without thinking of it first. The first step is conception in your mind, then you plan, then you build, then you pivot, and build and pivot and build and keep on iterating through this process until you've reached your end-goal. Everyone wants money, but so few think about it. So few plan about their money; what they're gonna spend it on; how much they will save. Fewer ask the question 'why do I need money?', they just know that money buys you things. But they never stop to realize that what money actually buys is <em>freedom</em>. It allows you to do what you want to do, wherever you want to do it, (within law) however you want to do it (granted use have enough of it). It's just a standardized way of obtaining something that you want. Seriously, can you imagine, you want a horse and the farmer says they'll only trade you a <a href="#media">dead lion<sup><sup><sup>rip Robin Williams</sup></sup></sup></a> for it? What a ways we've come.</p>

      <h2>This new layout is the new thing</h2>
      <p>I decided to try out my own design instead of using someone else's framework. HTML and CSS feel comfortable enough honestly. It's not as much of a tear-fest as programming in C.</p>
