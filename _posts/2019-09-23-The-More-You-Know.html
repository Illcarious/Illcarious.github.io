      <h2>Sh!t</h2>
      <p>Is it possible to stop yourself from having a crush on someone? Over the past couple of weeks I've noticed this girl at the gym and wow! is she ever gorgeous. She seems to hold herself high and isn't trying to be flashy in getting attention; she's just naturally pretty. What annoys me about this is I'm trying to just concentrate on my reps and sets at the gym but then seeing her is just distracting for my concentration haha. I've never known how to approach a girl at the gym; if I were to do anything I'd just start with 'hi'. But yeah, if she ever reads this (lol), just know that you are gorgeous and I think you shouldn't settle for anything less than what you deserve. Whether that's me or not, I'm not sure, I just know that if given the chance, you will not regret being with me.</p>
