      <h2>He said he named his dog after the coffee bean which was exported from an island called "<a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/why-is-coffee-called-java" target="_blank">Java</a>"</h2>
      <p>Now at this time I've only ever been playing web games online (oh the good old no download required days) and would always see the Java logo for when the game was loading. I wondered why he named his dog after this logo. So obviously I didn't know that coffee was exported from Java. Although hah! I guess you could say that I witnessed addiction being delivered through the internet to us from Java either way. (If you don't get it, don't bother).</p>
      <p>Now it wasn't until just recently that I found out the difference between Java and JavaScript, I mean I was doing a biology degree for the past 4 years so you can't really blame me. Java has been a real treat to program in. So much of the hard-coded stuff you need to worry about with C is just taken care of for you. No need to clean up after yourself. No need to create words from scratch. Just nice and fair programming. Now JavaScript, I've never used before. But I do know this now: it's used to make your website look better! Makes the site 'interactive' so-to-speak. I'm gonna use some JS in this post because I'm in the part of the CSS tutorial that's really dry and just getting us to play with the margins of the page and I'd rather get some work done on JS as well and I still have to sneak some jQuery in as well, so...</p>
