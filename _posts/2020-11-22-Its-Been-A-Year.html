      <h2>Haha what a year it's been</h2>
      <p>Who could've imagined the year we were all gonna go through. RIP Kobe, RIP sanity, RIP life as we knew it. Covid-19 has been a real kick in the butt and an eye-opener. People now (hopefully) understand how fleeting and fragile life is. I'm not gonna make this an opinion piece/real reflection of my thoughts right now. More of testing out this keyboard and putting up another post for my own sake.</p>
    <p>I decided that the year 2020 would be the year 20/20, year of clarity. No more distractions. No more bullsh!t. Just purposeful, meaningful grind. I can somewhat say so far that this is what it's been. Definitely a year of clarity. I see what my goals are now and what I lost in the preceding 1.5 ish years. I'm going to regain and exceed previous form.</p>

      <h2>Handshakes are illegal now</h2>
      <p>The new thing is the new norm. I wish the major thing was learning a new technology/stack/paradigm, etc. but no, the new thing is that Covid-19 has changed the norm. Facemasks are mandatory now; no more handshakes; 6 feet apart from one another; grocery stores are only selling essentials now. This sh!t is real. </p>
