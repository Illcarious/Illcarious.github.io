			<h1>My First Post</h1>
        <p>So I used someone else's tutorial to get this site's first layout and skeleton going, but I forgot that they told us to use Jekyll to help make posting pages easier.
        The point of me doing this is to learn the nuts and bolts of the coding and not to make a blog post so I am going to code every bit of this thing myself until I find it
        to be redundant.</p>
        <p>Also, as I was going through my <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank"><em>Codecademy</em></a> notes, I realized that I needed a structure to each post I make.
        So I think I will go with an "Introduction" which will have a different header each time to explain what the post will be about; a "New Thing" that I will try out; and a bit of "Media" to leave the post off
        on a fun note. Of course I might try some other stuff later on, but for now, this is what I'll do.</p>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li>
          <li><a href="#new thing">New Thing</a></li>
          <li><a href="#media">Media</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Nick and I'm a second year CS student. I finished a biology degree already and I've decided to pursue another degree/industry to broaden my career choices
        and to be able to create things on my own dime and time. The reason I'm pursuing another Bachelor's degree instead of doing a bootcamp or jumping into a Master's is because:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I notice that I perform faster and better when there is an external time constraint to keep me on task when it comes to studying</li>
			<li>I want to build a solid foundation first instead of rushing through and learning on the fly in order to get to the same knowledge and practice level as a Master's student</li>
	      </ol>
        <p>When it comes to leisure learning, during my peak, I was reading 6 books at a time (finished them in 6 weeks total == 1 book/week). I found that I got bored by grinding through one book, and so I tried to read 6 different
        books from totally different disciplines such as: Management, Food, Psychology, Autobiography, etc. and it would help to keep my mind and intrigue level fresh whilst introducing
        serendipity to my reading and information acquisition. I believe that everything in the world is related to one another and by putting different disciplines together, new ideas
        can form which would not necessarily have formed any other way (or in a slower timeframe). That is, after all, how the printing press was developed, when Gutenberg decided to
        use wine presses in a novel way<cite><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/printing-press#section_5" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a></cite>.
