          <h2>When I first posted about frameworks (on my <a href="/practice">practice</a> title page</h2>
          <p>I had no idea what it actually meant. Now I think I have a better understanding of it. It's basically a 'template' which utilizes an existing language that allows you to just <em>use</em> their code to do what you want without having to hardcode everything yourself. At least (without searching it up) that's what it looks like given that this <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework looks like it's doing. I just hope this turns out the way it did on <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a></p>

        <div id="new thing" class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>This whole style and layout is the 'new thing'</h2>
          <p>And yeah it feels like a cop-out new thing, but I don't think I want to get deep into a legitimate design at this moment. My Human-Computer Interaction project will get into that I'm pretty sure, so there's opportunity to really get a good website design going. Speaking of which, I'm thinking that the project my group should undertake is maybe a city tour app or a restaurant recommendation app. Just something with google maps API as well as a platform for some social input into our app/web app. What I <b>really<b> want to do though is try and redesign our uni's course registration site (and system) to give a good user experience and actual suggestions for course scheduling as well.</p>

        <div id="media" class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>I'm already mindf* with these nested divs</h2>
          <p>Just as long as it turns out the way it looks in the tutorial, then fine. Btw all this framework is supposed to do is allow for a responsive website (a.k.a. resizes the content appropriately across different devices and browser sizes.</p>
