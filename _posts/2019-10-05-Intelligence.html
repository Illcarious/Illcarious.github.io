      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <p>This isn't a game, this is practice. This is practice man. I mean if it were some suuuuper important thing, then yeah it'd be important but this is practice man. We're talking about practice man. <em>Practice</em>. This isn't a gentrified project, it's practice. We're talking about practice man. I know it's important, but we're talking about practice.</p>
      <p>Allen Iverson said the word <em>practice</em> 22 times. <strong><em>22</em></strong> times!!! Most university students aren't even 22 years old!! I know this has nothing to do with anything, it's just a fun-ny fact.</p>
      <p>And I'm done.</p>
      <p>But seriously, I have a quiz on CSS in the next couple of weeks, so I'm just trying to shake the rust off. And yeah, it's been a while since I've posted anything so just trying to remember my html layout style was an interesting experience.</p>
