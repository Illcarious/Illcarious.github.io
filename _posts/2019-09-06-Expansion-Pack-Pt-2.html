      <h2>Further experimentation</h2>
      <p>This HCI course is really speaking to me for some reason. I am by no means an adept designer (as you can see by my pt.1 post) but the design concepts and 'why worry about design' make a lot of sense. In <em>Steve Jobs</em> by Walter Isaacson, the most striking thing about his account of Steve Jobs was his innate ability/instinct to determine what will be a good design as seen by human beings (customers nonetheless). I feel like it is a very simple thing to strive towards because there ARE examples of great designs (e.g. iPhone, Tesla, NetFlix website, Google) and so it is also very easy to kind of 'brush off' to the side.</p>
