      <h2>The thing I looked forward to the most</h2>
      <p>During the winter, things get cold. You can't do anything. You're freezing and tired. But because people can find joy in anything, I would always look forward to building a snowman. Because you're creating something yourself; your parents won't say no; and it was a form of social interaction. At our school, there would be one kid that starts building a snowman. He would roll a snowball about half his height and then find another chunk of snow to start rolling. Then another kid would see this and he would want to compete with the first kid and he'd start rolling his own snowball. And then another. And another. Until there were patches of grass all over the field and there would be not enough snow to start a new snowman so the kids who were late coming out would start joining the other teams of existing snowmen. And the lead kid would start weeding out the lazy workers and these lazy workers would try to join one of his competitors and since the competitor needed more manpower they would accept this reject and they would all start building snowmen. Sometimes it feels like this world is just one kid who started to build a snowman because there was snow, and another followed suit. There are so many copy-cat/knock-off products on the market it's amazing. Amazon alone shows you the extent of copycat companies. Even content publishers are copycats. How many articles of the iPhone 11 have there been since yesterday? How many tell you one new thing each (and not just different synonyms of the same thing)?
